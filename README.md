# Nanopore genome assembly of the critically endangered Longtooth Sawfish (Pristis Pristis)

Chondrichthyans are among the oldest and most diverse lineage of marine vertebrates. Their long-standing place in the maintenance of coastal and oceanic ecosystems, via top-down regulation, tells us that they are both ecologically important and evolutionarily resilient. Chondrichthyans also play an important role in economy and food security, driven by the demand on fisheries for meat and fins and the emergence of globalised trade. Despite their importance and resilience, one quarter of all Chondrichthyans are currently considered threatened and only one third considered safe, placing the group at a high vulnerability to extinction. Global population declines, driven by commercial exploitation and lack of tailored management and conservation interventions, are a major concern for the loss of genetic diversity and compromised ability of a population to evolve and persist.

Sawfishes (family Pristidae) are considered among the most threatened Chondrichthyan families and availability of nuclear and mitochondrial genome sequence data to assist in their conservation is extremely limited. Using the largetooth sawfish (*Pristis pristis*) as an experimental model, we exploit low-coverage, long-read nanopore sequencing to enable a preliminary assembly of the largetooth sawfish genome and provides an estimate of genome size for additional data generation efforts.
